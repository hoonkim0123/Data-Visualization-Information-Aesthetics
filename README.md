## 📖 About

Franchise Viewing analyzes Netflix’s Top 200 TV franchises to reveal how audiences engage with long-running series — and how emotional tone (derived from TMDB episode summaries) shifts across seasons.

The core visualization is a Franchise Spine:
- Each row represents a franchise
- Each segment represents a season
- Width shows viewing hours (from Netflix’s What We Watched)
- Color shows average narrative sentiment (negative → neutral → positive)
Clicking a season opens an episode-level overlay, letting viewers explore how story beats evolve throughout the season.
